/**
 * Cloudflare Worker entry point.
 *
 * Static assets are uploaded from `dist/` and served by the asset server.
 * `run_worker_first: ["/api/*"]` in wrangler.jsonc sends only the API routes
 * here; everything else is served as a static asset (with the pretty 404 page).
 *
 * Types are declared inline rather than pulling in `@cloudflare/workers-types`,
 * which would clash with the DOM lib used by the Astro/React side of the repo.
